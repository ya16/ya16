### Hi there 👋

My name is Yusuf and I'm a Research Assistant @ the UCL Institute of Neurology! 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on :
  * Characteristicing molecular and connnectomic features of ALS and FTD including neurotransmitter profiles; 
  * Classifying patients with FTD using a Graph Neural Network
  * Systematically reviewing "[Peripheral and CSF inflammatory markers in individuals with ALS and FTD](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=212528)"
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about geometric deep learning! 
- 🧠 I'm interested in the crossover between health and data science!
